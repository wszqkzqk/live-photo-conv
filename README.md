Live Photo Converter is a cross-platform tool for processing live photos. It can combine a static image and a video into a live photo, convert a video directly into a live photo, repair live photos that fail to parse due to broken metadata, extract the static image and video from a live photo, or export every frame of the video as an image.

## Features

- `live-photo-make`
  - Create live photos from images and videos
- `live-photo-extract`
  - Extract images, videos, and video frames from live photos
- `live-photo-repair`
  - Repair corrupted live photos
- `live-photo-conv`
  - A comprehensive command for creating, extracting, and repairing live photos
- `copy-img-meta`
  - Copy all metadata from one image to another
  - Options to choose or exclude certain metadata types
- `liblivephototools`
  - A library that provides functions for creating and extracting live photos, as well as exporting frames from videos
  - The library can be used in **any** language that supports **GObject Introspection**

## Background [(Chinese Introduction)](https://wszqkzqk.github.io/2024/08/01/%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90Android%E7%9A%84%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E7%85%A7%E7%89%87/)

Android live photos are a gradually popularizing media file format that combines a video with audio and a static image to form a live photo. This type of photo is supported on various devices, such as Google's Pixel series, Samsung's Galaxy series, and most models from manufacturers like Xiaomi.

Essentially, an Android live photo appends a video file directly to the end of a static image. This video file contains both audio and video streams. The position of the video file is marked using `XMP` metadata, allowing quick location of the video file during parsing. The advantage of this format is that it adds dynamic effects to the image without altering the original image. Since this extension is not a standard for image formats, such images will only be displayed as static images in unsupported image viewers.

This tool can be used for extracting, repairing, editing, and composing such live photos.

## Build Scripts

This project provides build scripts for Arch Linux and Windows (MSYS2) environments.

### Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, you can install directly from the AUR using an AUR helper like `paru`:

```bash
paru -S live-photo-conv
```

Alternatively, you can manually clone the AUR repository and build/install:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/live-photo-conv.git
cd live-photo-conv
makepkg -si
```

### Windows (MSYS2)

On Windows (MSYS2), you can use the provided [`PKGBUILD`](https://gist.github.com/wszqkzqk/052a48feb5b84a469ee43231df91dc9d) to build. For example, execute the following commands in the `bash` shell of the MSYS2 UCRT64 environment:

```bash
mkdir live-photo-conv
cd live-photo-conv
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wszqkzqk/052a48feb5b84a469ee43231df91dc9d/raw/PKGBUILD
makepkg-mingw -si
```

sudo pacman -S --needed glib2 libgexiv2 meson vala gstreamer gst-plugins-base-libs gdk-pixbuf2 gobject-introspection gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugin-va
```

To install dependencies on Windows by MSYS2 (UCRT64 environment):

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glib2 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cc  mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gexiv2 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-meson mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-vala mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gstreamer mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gst-plugins-base mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gobject-introspection mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gst-plugins-good mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gst-plugins-bad
```

### Compilation

Use Meson and Ninja to build the project. When configuring the build with Meson, it automatically detects whether GStreamer is supported and whether GObject Introspection information can be generated.

Meson build options:

* `gst`
  * Whether to enable GStreamer
  * Possible values are `auto`, `enabled`, `disabled`. Default is `auto`.
* `gir`
  * Whether to generate GObject Introspection information
  * Possible values are `auto`, `enabled`, `disabled`. Default is `auto`.
* `docs`
  * Whether to generate documentation
  * Possible values are `auto`, `enabled`, `disabled`. Default is `auto`.

First, you need to clone the project and navigate to the top-level directory of the project. The following reference commands should be executed in the **top-level directory of the project**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wszqkzqk/live-photo-conv.git
cd live-photo-conv
```

You can configure the build with the following command:

```bash
meson setup builddir --buildtype=release
```

If you do not want to generate GObject Introspection information, for example, you can disable it with the following command:

```bash
meson setup builddir --buildtype=release -D gir=disabled
```

Then compile the project:

```bash
meson compile -C builddir
```

Install the project:

```bash
meson install -C builddir
```

## Usage

To simplify common tasks, this project provides three streamlined command-line tools, which are symbolic links to `live-photo-conv` but offer a more concise and focused set of options for specific tasks:

*   `live-photo-make`: For creating live photos from images and videos.
*   `live-photo-extract`: For extracting images, videos, and video frames from live photos.
*   `live-photo-repair`: For repairing corrupted live photos.

For complex scenarios that require all features, you can directly use the more comprehensive `live-photo-conv` command.

In addition, to address compatibility issues with live photos on Android devices, this project also provides the `copy-img-meta` tool for copying image metadata to [meet additional requirements from phone manufacturers](#fragmentation-among-android-manufacturers-live-photos-not-recognized).

```

Extract a live photo:

```bash
live-photo-conv --extract --live-photo /path/to/live_photo.jpg --dest-dir /path/to/dest
```

You can also use URI to specify the path:

```bash
live-photo-conv --make --image file:///path/to/image.jpg --video file:///path/to/video.mp4 --live-photo file:///path/to/output.jpg
```

Repair a live photo:

```bash
live-photo-conv --repair --live-photo /path/to/live_photo.jpg
```

```

Choose not to copy certain metadata:

```bash
copy-img-meta --exclude-xmp --exclude-iptc /path/to/exif-source.jpg /path/to/dest.webp
```

### `liblivephototools`

* **Warning:** The API of this library may change with future versions.

`liblivephototools` is a library for creating and extracting live photos, as well as exporting frames from embedded videos. It can be used in **any** language that supports **GObject Introspection**, such as C, Vala, Rust, C++, Python, etc.

#### Example

For example, in Python, make sure the `python-gobject` package has been installed, and then import the library:

```python
import gi
gi.require_version('LivePhotoTools', '0.4') # Adjust according to the actual version number
from gi.repository import LivePhotoTools
```

Usage example:

```python
# Load a live photo
livephoto = LivePhotoTools.LivePhotoGst.new("MVIMG_20241104_164717.jpg")
# Extract the static image from the live photo
livephoto.export_main_image()
# Extract the video from the live photo
livephoto.export_video()
# Export frames from the embedded video
livephoto.split_images_from_video(None, None, 0)
```

```python
# Create a live photo
livemaker = LivePhotoTools.LiveMakerGst.new('VID_20241104_164717.mp4', 'IMG_20241104_164717.jpg')
# Export
livemaker.export()
```

## Exporting Images from Embedded Videos: Using FFmpeg or GStreamer?

If GStreamer support is enabled during the build, GStreamer will be used by default to export images from embedded videos. Otherwise, the program will attempt to create an FFmpeg subprocess via command to export images. Even with GStreamer support enabled, you can use the `--use-ffmpeg` option to use FFmpeg.

The speed of exporting images using GStreamer versus FFmpeg is not always consistent. The GStreamer-based video export tool built by me encodes in parallel, and the number of threads can be controlled by adjusting the `-T`/`--threads` option. However, I has not optimized the decoding part of GStreamer very well; each frame undergoes a forced color space conversion （due to the [limitation of `gdk-pixbuf2`](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/property.Pixbuf.colorspace.html)）, which may introduce performance overhead. Therefore, in summary:

* When the selected image encoding is slow, GStreamer exports images faster.
* When the selected image encoding is fast, FFmpeg exports images faster.

## FAQ

### Path Encoding on Windows: Unable to Read/Write Metadata for Paths Containing Non-ASCII Characters

Due to limitations in Exiv2 and incomplete bindings in GExiv2, it is currently not possible on Windows to read or write metadata for paths that contain non-ASCII characters.

### Fragmentation Among Android Manufacturers: Live Photos Not Recognized

Due to the fragmentation among Android phone manufacturers, different vendors may require proprietary metadata in live photos to correctly recognize them. As a result, live photos generated by this tool may not be recognized on some devices.

Workarounds:

* Take a photo (usually not live photo) with a phone from the respective manufacturer.
* Use `copy-img-meta --exclude-xmp <source_image> <dest_image>` to copy the metadata from that photo to the generated live photo.
* If the phone recognizes the live photo but fails to play it, repair the live photo using the `live-photo-conv` tool:
  * For example, run `live-photo-conv --repair -p /path/to/live_photo.jpg`
  * Or force a repair with `live-photo-conv --force-repair -p /path/to/live_photo.jpg`
  * In rare cases where the repair still fails, you can try specifying the embedded video size using `live-photo-conv --repair-with-video-size=SIZE -p /path/to/live_photo.jpg` (usually not necessary)

You can also copy the metadata to the ordinary photo used to create the live photo beforehand, and then use the `live-photo-conv` tool to create the live photo (recommended):

```bash
copy-img-meta --exclude-xmp /path/to/source.jpg /path/to/dest.jpg
live-photo-conv --make --image /path/to/dest.jpg --video /path/to/video.mp4 --live-photo /path/to/output.jpg
```

This way, you can obtain a live photo that is recognized and playable on the respective brand's phone.

### The Role of the `--oppo-compatible` Option

OPPO uses XMP metadata tags that differ from both the old and new standards of Google. Therefore, if the generated photo needs to be played on OPPO devices, this option must be used. Additionally, users may still need to refer to the [previous section](#fragmentation-among-android-manufacturers-live-photos-not-recognized) and use the `copy-img-meta` tool to copy EXIF and other metadata to the generated live photo.
